## Project Overview
This project was completed for the Data Masters Challenge Olympiad, organized by Dr. Sana Spectre from Canisius University. 
Our team worked as data consultants for the Data Masters Challenge Olympiad, a real-world simulation where we were tasked with solving energy optimization problems. Our client was a major real estate investment trust (REIT) managing over 1,600 commercial buildings across North America and Europe. Rising energy costs and carbon penalties created the need for data-driven solutions.

## Objectives
- Analyze electricity, water, and gas usage across commercial properties.
- Identify seasonal trends and building type energy patterns.
- Develop predictive models to forecast future energy consumption.
- Recommend actionable strategies to reduce energy waste by 20% over two years.

## Files Attached
- **DataMasters2_Clean.ipynb** — Data cleaning and preparation of the dataset.
- **DataMasters2_Exploratory.ipynb** — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including graphs for usage over time, building type, month, and weekday patterns.
- **DataMasters2_PredictiveModel.ipynb** — Predictive modeling using machine learning to forecast future energy usage.
- **Business_Insight_Report.pdf** — Business insights and cost-saving recommendations based on the analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Scikit-Learn (for modeling)
- Google Colab
- Git and GitHub

## Key Findings
- Electricity and water usage peak in the summer months, while gas usage peaks in the winter.
- Healthcare and lodging buildings account for the highest energy usage.
- Targeted improvements such as solar panel installation, HVAC upgrades, and better insulation could lead to significant cost savings.

## Business Recommendations
- Implement energy efficient upgrades (LED lighting, centralized HVAC systems).
- Improve building insulation to reduce gas usage.
- Focus on energy saving initiatives during peak summer and winter periods.
